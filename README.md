## Installation üì≤

1. **Download the Latest Release**:
   - Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/jeryjs/Party-Scan/releases/latest) page on GitHub.
   - Download the latest `APK` file for Android or the `IPA` file for iOS.

2. **Install the App**:
   - **Android**: 
     - Transfer the `APK` to your device and install it.
     - Multiple variants are available. If the `arm64-v8a` variant fails to install, try installing the `armeabi-v7a` variant.
   - **iOS**: 
     - Download the `IPA` file and use a tool like AltStore or Cydia Impactor to sideload the app onto your iOS device. 
     - Alternatively, if you have access to Xcode, you can build and install the app directly.

3. **Launch the App**:
   - On the first launch, you'll be prompted to set the collection name, which will be used to retrieve your barcodes databse from Firebase.
   - After configuring the collection name, the app is ready to start scanning barcodes!


## Building üõ†Ô∏è

## Usage üöÄ

- **Scanning Barcodes**:
  - Upon opening the app, the camera scanner will start automatically.
  - Scan a ticket by placing its barcode in front of the scanner.
  - The app will show an animated green box with a tick for success or a red box with a cross if the barcode was already scanned.

- **Navigating the Bottom Sheet**:
  - Tap the navigation icons to slide up the bottom sheet, where you can view scanned and unscanned barcodes.
  - Use the search bar at the top of each list to filter by barcode or scan time.

- **Changing the Collection Name**:
  - Tap the settings icon in the top-right corner to open the collection name dialog.
  - Enter a new collection name and confirm to save your changes.
    - Collection names are basically like a private key to let you safely manage your tickets database.
